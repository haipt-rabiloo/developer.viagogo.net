# Managing Sales

Using API v2, your application can manage ticket sales on behalf of a user.
The examples below assume that your
[application has an access token for a user](#user-login-authentication-flow)
and that the token has the appropriate [scopes](#scopes) for read and write
access to the user's sales. Please see our
[Customer Service](http://www.viagogo.co.uk/help) page for answers to any
non-API questions you may have about selling, or shipping tickets on the viagogo
platform.
