## Create Listings for viagogo Events

API v2 enables your application to create listings for events on the viagogo
platform using the steps below. Creating listings directly against events
already on the platform is the quickest way to get a user's inventory active and
available for purchase on the viagogo marketplace.

This example assumes that your
[application has an access token for a user](#user-login-authentication-flow) and that
the token has the appropriate [scopes](#scopes) for read and write access to the
user's listings.

> **1. Find the Event that you want to list tickets for**

<%= curl('GET', EVENT['_links']['self']['href']) %>

~~~ csharp
var @event = await api.Events.GetAsync(<%= EVENT['id'] %>);
~~~

~~~ ruby
event = api.get_event <%= EVENT['id'] %>
~~~

> **2. Get the constraints for listings on that event**

<%= curl('GET', EVENT['_links']['event:listingconstraints']['href']) %>

~~~ csharp
var constraints = await api.Hypermedia.GetAsync<ListingConstraints>(@event.ListingConstraintsLink);
~~~

~~~ ruby
# TODO
~~~

> **3. Create the listing**

~~~ shell
curl -X POST "<%= EVENT['_links']['event:createsellerlisting']['href'] %>"
     -H "User-Agent: MyAwesomeApp"
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <%= ResourceHelpers::CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_TOKEN["access_token"] %>"
     -d '{"seating":{"section":"107","row":"A","seat_from":"1","seat_to":"4"},"ticket_price":{"amount":25.65,"currency_code":"USD"},"face_value":{"amount":22.62,"currency_code":"EUR"},"ticket_type":"ETicket","split_type":"Any","number_of_tickets":2,"guarantee_payment_method_id":95698}'
