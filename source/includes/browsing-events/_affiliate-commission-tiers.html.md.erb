## Affiliate Commission Tiers

viagogo affiliates can use API v2 to identify the commissions available for an
[`Event`](#event) by checking its `affiliate_commission_tier` property. This
property will have one of the following values:

* `Low` - Affiliates are eligible for lower commissions on mega events or events
where viagogo is the official ticketing partner
* `Normal` - Affiliates are eligible for standard commissions
