<%= json(:seller_listing) %>

You can use a `POST` request on the href of this link to create a
[`SellerListing`](#sellerlisting) for an event. If the event information in your
request maps to an event already on the viagogo platform then the listing will be
created for that event. Otherwise, the listing will be created against your
"requested event" and it will automatically be mapped to an event on the viagogo
platform when your "requested event" is accepted. This endpoint requires the
`write:sellerlistings` and `write:requestedevents` scopes.
