API v2 makes it simple to request only the data that has changed since a
previous request made by your application. This functionality is particularly
useful for applications that are storing API response data in a database and can
help any application to reduce the number of requests required to retrieve
viagogo data.

### 1. Check whether the resource supports sorting by `resource_version`

Only certain resources such as [`Category`](#category), [`Event`](#event) and
[`SellerListing`](#seller-listing) resources support requesting data changes.
Check the resource documentation to see whether the resource can be sorted by
`resource_version`.

### 2. Request the resource sorted by `resource_version`

Request the resources you are interested in with the [`sort`](#sorting) query
parameter set to `resource_version`. This will cause the resources returned in
the `items` property of the response to be ordered by the time they were last
updated (the oldest resource will be first). The `deleted_items` property will
contain items that have been deleted within the same time frame.

### 3. Follow the `next` link to get resources that have changed since your last request

With the items sorted by the time they were updated, the `next` link in the
response will always represent a request for resources that have changed since
your last request.

### 4. Store the `next` link in your database until the next time you want to get updates

The `next` link can be stored and used later (e.g. the next time your
application runs) to continue retrieving resources that have changed since the
last time you requested data.
