## Creating Listings

API v2 enables your application to create listings on behalf of users. This
example assumes that your
[application has an access token for a user](#authorization-code-grant) and that
the token has the appropriate [scopes](#scopes) for read and write access to the
user's listings.

> **1. Find the Event that you want to list tickets for**

<%= curl('GET', EVENT['_links']['self']['href']) %>

~~~ csharp
var @event = await api.Events.GetAsync(<%= EVENT['id'] %>);

event = api.get_event <%= EVENT['id'] %>

> **2. Get the constraints for listings on that event**

<%= curl('GET', EVENT['_links']['event:listingconstraints']['href']) %>

~~~ csharp
var constraints = await api.Hypermedia.GetAsync<ListingConstraints>(@event.ListingConstraintsLink);
