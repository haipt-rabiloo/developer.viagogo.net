## Managing Sales

Using API v2, your application can manage ticket sales on behalf of a user.
This example assumes that your
[application has an access token for a user](#user-login-authentication-flow) and that
the token has the appropriate [scopes](#scopes) for read and write access to the
user's sales. Please see our [Customer Service](http://www.viagogo.co.uk/help)
page for answers to any non-API questions you may have about selling, or
shipping tickets on the viagogo platform.


### 1. Accessing your sales

Follow the [`user:sales`](#usersales) link on the [`User`](#user) resource to
get all of the [`Sale`](#sale) resources for your account.


### 2. Confirming sales

When your tickets have sold, you should confirm your sale promptly by
using the [`sale:confirm`](#saleconfirm) link. If there is a problem with
your sale, you should use the [`sale:reject`](#salereject) link.


### 3. Uploading E-Tickets for your sale

As soon as you have your tickets and are ready to upload them, you can use the
[`sale:uploadetickets`](#saleuploadetickets) link to upload one or more files
containing one or more tickets. The files that you upload will be represented as
[`ETicketUpload`](#eticketupload) resources that will contain separate
[`ETicket`](#eticket) resources for each ticket in the file(s). You can then
submit the `id`s of the [`ETicket`](#eticket) resources that you want to assign
to the sale in the [`sale:saveetickets`](#salesaveetickets) link.


### 4. Shipping your tickets

As soon as you have your tickets and are ready to ship them to your buyer, use
the [`sale:shipments`](#saleshipments) link to get the [`Shipments`](#shipments)
resource related to your sale. When you are ready to ship, follow the
[`shipment:create`](#shipmentcreate) create a [`Shipment`](#shipment) and then
follow the [`shipment:label`](#shipmentlabel) link to get the full details on
how to ship the tickets.


### 5. Arranging a courier collection

For some delivery methods, such as UPS, it is necessary to arrange a courier
collection. After creating a [`Shipment`](#shipment) (see [#4](#shipping-your-tickets)),
choose the collection [`address`](#address) from the shipment's `pickup_addresses`
property and follow the [`address:carrier`](#addresscarrier) link to view the [pickup windows](#pickupwindow)
available for the courier. Use the [`carrier:createpickup`](#carriercreatepickup)
link to create a [`Pickup`](#pickup) for the given window.
