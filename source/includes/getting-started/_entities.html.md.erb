## Entities

The main entities in the API are events, listings and categories.

An [`Event`](#event) is a show/festival/match/etc, taking place at a venue, for which tickets can be bought and sold.

A [`Listing`](#listing) is a set of one or more tickets for an event.

A [`Category`](#category) is a grouping of similar events or categories. Categories in the viagogo platform are arranged in a tree hierarchy where categories near the root of the tree (direct children of the root) are referred to as *genres* (e.g. "Concerts", "Threatre", "Festival", "Sports") and categories that are leaves of the tree are referred to as *performers*.
