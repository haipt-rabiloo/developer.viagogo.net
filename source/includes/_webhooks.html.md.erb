# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations that subscribe to certain
topics on the viagogo platform. When an occurrence of a topic happens we'll send
a `POST` payload to the webhook's configured URL. Once a webhook is created, it
will be triggered each time one or more of the subscribed topics occurs.


## Topics

When configuring a webhook, you can choose the topics you would like to receive
payloads for. You should only subscribe to the specific topics that you plan on
handling so that you can limit the number of HTTP requests to your server.

The available topics are:

| **Name** | **Description** |
| [`Sales`](#salestopic) | Any time something happens that affects a [`Sale`](#sale) (e.g. you sell one or more tickets) |


## Payloads

The payload for each topic has a similar JSON schema, but a unique piece of data
that is relevant to that topic.

### Delivery Headers

HTTP requests made to your webhook's configured URL endpoint will contain
several specific headers:

| **Header** | **Description** |
| VGG-Topic | Name of the [`topic`](#topics) that triggered this delivery |
| VGG-DeliveryId | Unique identifier for this delivery |

Also, the `User-Agent` for the requests will have the prefix `Viagogo-Webhooks/`.
