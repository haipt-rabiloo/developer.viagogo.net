Each HTTP connection that your application makes results in a certain amount of
overheader. viagogo API v2 supports batching, to allow your application to put
several API calls into a single HTTP request.

You may want to use batching when:

* Your application needs to update the metadata of a lot of different resources
* Your application needs to delete many resources

You're limited to 50 API calls in single batch request. If you need to make more
calls than that, use multiple batch requests.

### Format of a batch request

A batch request is a single standard HTTP request with `multipart/mixed` content
type that contains multiple nested HTTP requests within each part of its body.
Each part begins with its own `Content-Type: application/http` HTTP header and
the body of each part is a complete HTTP request with a verb, URL, headers and
body.

### Format of a batch response

The server's response is a single standard HTTP request with `multipart/mixed`
content type; each part is the response to one of the requests in the batched
request, in the same order as the requests.
