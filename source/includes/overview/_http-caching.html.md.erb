## HTTP Caching

### Cache-Control Header

Most responses return a `Cache-Control` header with a `max-age` value that
indicates the number of seconds your application can cache a particular response
for. You don't need to request a resource any more frequently than every
`max-age` seconds.

### E-Tag Header

All responses return the `ETag` header. You can use the value of this header to
make subsequent requests to those resources using the `If-None-Match` header.
If the resource has not changed, the server will return a `304 Not Modified`
response with an empty body.
