## Sorting

Paginated results can be sorted according to one of more criteria using the
`sort` param. Clients can specify sort criteria as a comma-separated list of the
names of fields that should be used to sort. The default sort order is ascending
but a *-* prefix on any sort field specifies a descending sort order.

<%= %(`GET https://api.viagogo.net/v2/categories/#{CATEGORY["id"]}/events?sort=start_date,-ticket_price`) %>

The example request above sorts results by `start_date` ascending and then by
`ticket_price` descending.
