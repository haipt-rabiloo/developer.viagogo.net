## Quick Reference

> Libraries are [available in several languages](#libraries).

> **API Root Endpoint:** `https://api.viagogo.net/v2`

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.viagogo.net` domain.
Request and response payloads are formatted as `application/hal+json`, which is
basically just plain old JSON with hyperlinks (see [Media Type](#media-type)).
We support [cross-origin resource sharing][cors] to allow you to interact
securely with our API from a client-side web application. [OAuth2][oauth2]
is used for all authentication. All API requests must be authenticated or you
will receive a `401 Unauthorized` error response (see
[Authentication](#authentication)).

[oauth2]: http://oauth.net/2/

Before accessing viagogo APIs, you need to register your application.
During the beta period, API access will be available by invitation only.
