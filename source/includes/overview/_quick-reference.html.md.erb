## Quick Reference

> Libraries are [available in several languages](#libraries).

> **API Root Endpoint:** `https://api.viagogo.net/v2`

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.viagogo.net` domain.
Request and response payloads are formatted as `application/hal+json`, which is
basically just plain old JSON with hyperlinks (see [Media Type](#media-type)).
We support [cross-origin resource sharing][cors] to allow you to interact
securely with our API from a client-side web application. [OAuth2][oauth2]
is used for all authentication. All API requests must be authenticated or you
will receive a `401 Unauthorized` error response (see
[Authentication](#authentication)).

[cors]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[oauth2]: http://oauth.net/2/

Before accessing viagogo APIs, you need to register your application.
During the beta period, API access will be available by invitation only.


### Buyer Entities

The main entities in the API related to buying tickets are events, listings and
categories.

An [`Event`](#event) is a show/festival/match/etc, taking place at a venue, for
which tickets can be bought and sold.

A [`Listing`](#listing) is a set of one or more tickets for an event.

A [`Category`](#category) is a grouping of similar events or categories.
Categories in the viagogo platform are arranged in a tree hierarchy where
categories near the root of the tree (direct children of the root) are referred
to as *genres* (e.g. "Concerts", "Threatre", "Festival", "Sports") and categories
that are leaves of the tree are referred to as *performers*.

### Seller Entities

seller-listings and sales.

A [`SellerListing`](#sellerlisting) is a set of one or more tickets for sale on
the viagogo marketplace that belong to a seller.

A [`Sale`](#sale) is an order for one or more of a seller's tickets that sold on
the viagogo marketplace.
