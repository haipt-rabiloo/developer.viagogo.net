To safely retry an API request without accidently performing the same operation
twice, you can attach a unique key to any `POST` request via the
`Idempotency-Key: <key>` header.

For example, if a request to [`create a listing`](#eventcreatesellerlisting)
fails due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same
key to guarantee that only a single listing is created.

The key can be any UUID value and the viagogo API will always send back the same
response for requests made with the same key. Keys expire after 24 hours.
