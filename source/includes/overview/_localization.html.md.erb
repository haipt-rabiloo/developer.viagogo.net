## Localization

viagogo API v2 supports various request headers to return locale-specific
content in responses.

### Accept-Language Header

The `Accept-Language` header can be used to determine the language of the API
response content (e.g. event names and error messages). Content will be returned
in English if no `Accept-Language` header is provided, or viagogo does not
currently support the requested language codes.

`Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7`

In the example header above, the request is specifying "I prefer Danish, but
will accept British English and other types of English." See more information
about the [Accept-Language header][acceptlang].

### Accept-Currency Header

The `Accept-Currency` header can be used to determine the currency of responses
that include monetary values. For example, [Listing](#listing) resources have a
`ticket_display_price` property that gives the price-per-ticket in the currency
requested by the application. The value of the `Accept-Currency` header should
be a three-letter currency code as defined by [ISO 4217][iso4217].

`Accept-Currency: eur`

In the example above, the request is specifying that it would like to receive
monetary values in Euros where possible.

### VGG-Country Header

Applications can include the `VGG-Country` header to change the
geography-context of requests. Each domain of the viagogo website is referred to
as a _geography_ that has its own category-structure and language, currency and
content defaults. The value of the `VGG-Country` header should be a two-letter
country code as defined by [ISO 3166][iso3166]. If an application does not
provide a `VGG-Country` header then the API will default to the _US_ geography
(www.viagogo.com).

`VGG-Country: FR`

In the example above, the application is specifying that it would like make
requests in the French geography (as if the client were using the www.viagogo.fr
website).
