## Sandbox Environment

viagogo API v2 is supported in two environments. You can use our *sandbox*
environment for testing purposes, before moving to the *production*. Use your
sandbox credentials to make calls to the sandbox environment. When you're set
to go live, use your production credentials to make calls to the production
environment.

* Sandbox API v2 root endpoint: `https://sandbox.api.viagogo.net/v2`
* Sandbox OAuth2 token endpoint: `https://sandbox.account.viagogo.com/oauth2/token`
