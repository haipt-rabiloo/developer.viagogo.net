## Arrange Courier Collection

For some delivery methods, such as UPS, it is necessary to arrange a courier
collection. After creating a [`Shipment`](#shipment) (see [#4](#shipping-your-tickets)),
choose the collection [`address`](#address) from the shipment's `pickup_addresses`
property and follow the [`address:carrier`](#addresscarrier) link to view the [pickup windows](#pickupwindow)
available for the courier. Use the [`carrier:createpickup`](#carriercreatepickup)
link to create a [`Pickup`](#pickup) for the given window.
