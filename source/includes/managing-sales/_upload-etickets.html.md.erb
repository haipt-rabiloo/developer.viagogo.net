## Upload E-Tickets For Your Sale

As soon as you have your tickets and are ready to upload them, you can use the
[`sale:uploadetickets`](#saleuploadetickets) link to upload one or more files
containing one or more tickets. The files that you upload will be represented as
[`ETicketUpload`](#eticketupload) resources that will contain separate
[`ETicket`](#eticket) resources for each ticket in the file(s). You can then
submit the `id`s of the [`ETicket`](#eticket) resources that you want to assign
to the sale in the [`sale:saveetickets`](#salesaveetickets) link.
